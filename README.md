## üö® Unusal patterns are observed

Power generation usually follows a curve with a peak at midday; however, on certain days, this pattern is not observed


üí° Efforts to Resolve
- To isolate days exhibiting such unique patterns, various techniques were employed, including time-series clustering, error rate-based clustering, seasonal and hourly clustering, and variable selection methods. Subsequent modeling was performed for each cluster.
- It was assumed that days with unique patterns must have occurred in the past. Derived variables were created using vector similarity.
